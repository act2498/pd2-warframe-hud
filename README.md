# Warframe HUD

This is a total in-game HUD conversion that aims to recreate Warframe's HUD as close as possible. It includes features like floating enemy labels, damage pops (with Warframe style damage type icons where applicable) and a list of currently active buffs. It uses completely custom fonts that are closer to Warframe's as well as many custom icons for HUD elements and waypoints.
